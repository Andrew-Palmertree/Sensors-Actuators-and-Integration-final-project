# Sensors, Actuators and Integration Final Project
### Group members names: Reanna Kennedy, Kevin Toyle, and Andrew Palmertree 

Description of our final project:

In our CPE 4010 â€“ Sensors, Actuators, and Integration Project, our team of three members is embarking on an exciting endeavor to bring the "Red Light - Green Light" game to life, inspired by the Squid Game movie. The project's aim is to employ Arduino, a multitude of sensors, and various actuators to recreate this thrilling game scenario. It involves one player positioned at one end of the field, and a group of players on the opposite side. The lone player alternates between saying "Green Light" and "Red Light" while turning away from the group. The challenge is for the group to advance during "Green Light" and freeze during "Red Light," all while avoiding getting caught when the lone player turns or when the time runs out. Our project encompasses multiple components, including an ultrasonic range sensor attached to a servo motor for the lone player, Red and Green LEDs for visual cues, a buzzer for auditory signals, and an LCD display to count down the 60-second time limit. We've also devised an elimination mechanism, featuring a servo motor with an arm that sweeps across the field to eliminate players. A lightweight target player moves towards the ultrasonic sensor. The game begins and restarts via a push button, and we've integrated external and timer interrupts for precision control. The minimum requirement involves manual player movement, while the stretch goal incorporates a stepper motor and string for automated player motion. In the challenging goal, we introduce an MPU-6050 accelerometer to control the player's movement and randomize the "Green Light" and "Red Light" periods. Our project offers group participation, with the expectation of meeting the minimum requirements and  Stretch and challenging goals for a full grade. We will work on a project report and create a 10-minute system demonstration. Our overarching objective is to create an engaging and interactive "Red Light - Green Light" game, capturing the essence of the Squid Game and showcasing our expertise in sensors, actuators, and integration.
